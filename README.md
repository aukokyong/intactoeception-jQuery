<h2> Game Objective</h2>

First player to get 3 cells in a row to win!

<br>

<h2>Game Mechanics </h2>

- This is a 2 players game, to be played within 9 cells marked as shown:

| C1  | C2  | C3  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C4  | C5  | C6  |
| C7  | C8  | C9  |

<br>

- Each cell is further divided into 9 similar squares as shown:

| 1   | 2   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4   | 5   | 6   |
| 7   | 8   | 9   |

<br>

- Player 1 uses "O" to mark the cells while player 2 uses "X" to mark the cells

- Each player takes turn to place their mark. The cell where a player places his mark will determine where the next player can place his mark. For example, if player 1 marks “O” in the square 9 of C9, player 2 can only place his “X” anywhere within C9. If player 2 marks square 5 of C9, then the
  next cell that player 1 marks must be in C5. If player 1 then marks square 1 of C5, player 2 must only mark in C1

- First player to have 3 in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) in a cell, wins that cell.

- If a cell has been won, say C9, and if player 1 places his mark on square 9 in of cell C1 to C8, player 2 is free to choose where he wants to mark next.

- First player to win 3 cells in a row, wins the game.

Good Luck!
