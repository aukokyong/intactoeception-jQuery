<h2>Game Mechanics </h2>

- The game is played on a 3 by 3 square cells (main-grid).
- Inside each cell, there is another 3 by 3 square cells (sub-grid).
- Each turn, players will take turn to place their marking in the 3 by 3 sub-grid. The location where a player place their marking, will determine the next player's available options.
- For example, if a player place his/her piece in the bottom right hand corner of a sub-grid, the next player will only be allowed to put on the sub-grid within the bottom right hand corner cell of the main-grid.
- For a guide, players are only allowed to place their marking on cells that are highlighted in yellow.
- If a player places on a sub-grid that is aready occupied on the main-grid, the next player is allowed to place anywhere on the sub-grid.
- First player to get 3 in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) in the sub-grid, wins the cell.
- First player to get 3 in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) on the main-grid, wins the game!

Good Luck!
